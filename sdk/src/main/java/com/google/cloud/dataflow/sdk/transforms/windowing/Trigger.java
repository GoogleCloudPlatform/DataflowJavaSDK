/**
 * {@code Trigger}s control when the elements for a specific key and window are output. As elements
 * arrive, they are put into one or more windows by a {@link Window} transform and its associated
 * {@link WindowFn}, and then passed to the associated {@code Trigger} to determine if the
 * {@code Window}s contents should be output.
 *
 * <p>See {@link com.google.cloud.dataflow.sdk.transforms.GroupByKey} and {@link Window}
 * for more information about how grouping with windows works.
 *
 * <p>The elements that are assigned to a window since the last time it was fired (or since the
 * window was created) are placed into the current window pane. Triggers are evaluated against the
 * elements as they are added. When the root trigger fires, the elements in the current pane will be
 * output. When the root trigger finishes (indicating it will never fire again), the window is
 * closed and any new elements assigned to that window are discarded.
 *
 * <p>Several predefined {@code Trigger}s are provided:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> {@link AfterWatermark} for firing when the watermark passes a timestamp determined from
 *   either the end of the window or the arrival of the first element in a pane.
 *   <li> {@link AfterProcessingTime} for firing after some amount of processing time has elapsed
 *   (typically since the first element in a pane).
 *   <li> {@link AfterPane} for firing off a property of the elements in the current pane, such as
 *   the number of elements that have been assigned to the current pane.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition, {@code Trigger}s can be combined in a variety of ways:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> {@link Repeatedly#forever} to create a trigger that executes forever. Any time its
 *   argument finishes it gets reset and starts over. Can be combined with
 *   {@link Trigger#orFinally} to specify a condition that causes the repetition to stop.
 *   <li> {@link AfterEach#inOrder} to execute each trigger in sequence, firing each (and every)
 *   time that a trigger fires, and advancing to the next trigger in the sequence when it finishes.
 *   <li> {@link AfterFirst#of} to create a trigger that fires after at least one of its arguments
 *   fires. An {@link AfterFirst} trigger finishes after it fires once.
 *   <li> {@link AfterAll#of} to create a trigger that fires after all least one of its arguments
 *   have fired at least once. An {@link AfterAll} trigger finishes after it fires once.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each trigger tree is instantiated per-key and per-window. Every trigger in the tree is in one
 * of the following states:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Never Existed - before the trigger has started executing, there is no state associated
 *   with it anywhere in the system. A trigger moves to the executing state as soon as it
 *   processes in the current pane.
 *   <li> Executing - while the trigger is receiving items and may fire. While it is in this state,
 *   it may persist book-keeping information to persisted state, set timers, etc.
 *   <li> Finished - after a trigger finishes, all of its book-keeping data is cleaned up, and the
 *   system remembers only that it is finished. Entering this state causes us to discard any
 *   elements in the buffer for that window, as well.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Once finished, a trigger cannot return itself back to an earlier state, however a composite
 * trigger could reset its sub-triggers.
 *
 * <p>Triggers should not build up any state internally since they may be recreated
 * between invocations of the callbacks. All important values should be persisted using
 * state before the callback returns.
